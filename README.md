Dear User

To run this project, first please run "<b>composer install</b>"

Then please create a MySQL DB with this name "<b>test_task</b>" then import the file that is called "<b>test_task.sql</b>"

The place to edit DB connection is "<b>lib\model.class</b>" in the "<b>__construct</b>" function 

To run the project you have to use apache server

You can enter the project using this url "http://localhost/MyFramework/webroot/"

Thanks
